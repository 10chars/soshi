# Idea behind 素子(soshi)
to create a simple component system that can be added to any framework.

## Template literals
these export very well with google closure compiler into normal string.

## Yoyo and Morphdom 
Lightweight module for morphing an existing DOM node tree to match a target DOM node tree. It's fast and works with the real DOM—no virtual DOM needed!
